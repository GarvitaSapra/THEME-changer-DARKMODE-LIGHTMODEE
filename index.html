        <p class="f">Betrayed by the king he faithfully served, Kim Shin (Gong Yoo), a decorated military general from the Goryeo Dynasty, is forced to watch his family die before being transformed into a goblin by the higher powers. Cursed with the lonely burden of immortality, Kim Shin dedicates the rest of his long life to saving people with his supernatural abilities. Still, he wanders through his days searching for the prophesied Goblin bride. The bride is the only one who can pull out the sword piercing his body which will finally set his soul free to rest in peace in the afterlife.<BR><br>
19 years ago, Kim Shin saved a woman from a life-threatening accident. From then on, the woman’s daughter Ji Eun Tak (Kim Go Eun) gained the ability to communicate with beings from the other side. Despite this, she grows up well and remains an optimistic high schooler who works a part-time job at a chicken restaurant. The restaurant’s owner, Sunny (Yoo In Na), finds herself falling in love with a grim reaper (Lee Dong Wook), who is also the goblin’s roommate.<br><br>
Unknowingly, the lives of these four individuals intertwine to reveal a fated story more complex than any character could have imagined. Will Kim Shin’s bride finally release him from his eternal misery? </p>
